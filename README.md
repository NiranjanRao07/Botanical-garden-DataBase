# Botanical-garden-DataBase

- I have created a small botanical garden database as a part of my DBMS project.
- It contains frontend for which I have used pythons StreamLit and SQL for backend.

- Download all the necessary libraries, and run the streamlit on your command prompt which will open the
localhost on your befault browser.
